Generics: For reusable, type-safe classes/functions

Decorators: Metadata and behavior annotation for classes/methods (common in frameworks like NestJS)

Advanced Types: Union, intersection, mapped types, conditional types

Async patterns in TS: Promise<T> typing, async/await patterns

Namespaces (optional): Though modules are preferred in modern projects
Here’s a **list of TypeScript concepts you still need to study or practice** based on your progress:

---

## **1. Advanced Types**

* **Generics** – reusable type-safe functions, classes, and interfaces
* **Intersection Types** – combining multiple types into one
* **Union Types** – a variable can be one of multiple types
* **Mapped Types** – transform existing types into new types
* **Conditional Types** – types based on conditions

---

## **2. Advanced Functions & Patterns**

* **Closures in TypeScript** – using closures with strong typing
* **Function Overloads** – multiple signatures for a single function

---

## **3. Decorators**

* **Class, Method, Property, and Parameter Decorators**
* Use cases: logging, validation, metadata in frameworks like NestJS

---

## **4. Modules & Project Structuring (Advanced)**

* **Namespaces vs Modules** – mostly modules in modern TS
* **Organizing large-scale apps**: models, services, utils
* **Avoiding circular dependencies**

---

## **5. Asynchronous Patterns**

* **Promises and async/await with typed results**
* **Typing API responses**
* **Error handling in async TS functions**

---

## **6. Practical Project-Level Applications**

* Combine **Interfaces, Classes, Generics, Modules, and Decorators** in real-world projects:

  * CRUD apps
  * Mini dashboards
  * API services
* **Validation & Business Rules** using getters/setters and decorators
* **Reusable type-safe utilities**

---

### ✅ **Next Step**

* Focus on **Generics, Intersection/Union Types, Decorators, Async Patterns**, and **real-world project exercises**.
* After this, you will have **complete practical TypeScript mastery** for production-level development.

If you want, I can **create a full “TypeScript Study Roadmap”** showing **all concepts, their order, and practice exercises** so you can systematically cover everything.

Do you want me to do that?
